#Installing Python 
Installing Python is quite easy, since there is a lot of information online about it, but i recommend having a look at this [Install Python](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download)

Before getting started, you might  want to find out which IDEs and text editors are supported for python, i personally recommend [Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) from JetBrains,
since it is the one i use the most, but if u are looking for a simpler editor, [Mu](https://codewith.mu/) works fine aswell.
